# TIPE

Work for a competitive exam, originally not finished (only the file `original/my_mfcc.py`). My work was presented in July of 2023.
The goal was to identify bird species only by their singing, using the Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients.

## Original
The original part of the TIPE, containing `my_mfcc.py`, the work itself and `TIPE_pr√©sentation.pdf` the slides used for the presentation.

## bird_CLEF_mfcc
Machine learning part of the TIPE using the birdCLEF dataset.
For the purpuses of the study, I am going to use the function `librosa.feature.mfcc()` from the library `librosa` to calculate the mfcc.
